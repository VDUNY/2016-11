Create the SilverLight App
  Will need to install SilverLight on the computer. May not run in Chrome. Can NOT debug Silverlight in Chrome.
  New SilverLight App: uncheck the Host SilverLight App in New Web Site
  Delete the main page and remove the call to create it in App.xaml.cs.Application_Startup()
  Create a new SilverLight User Control to act as the shell. Name the file 'Shell.xaml'.
  Create the bootstrapper in a new class and call it 'Bootstrapper.cs'.
